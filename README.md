# Habit-Tracker-Cat
A 21-day habit tracker built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript when I was 16. Each habit is represented by a line of 21 cat-styled checkboxes, tracking progress with playful visuals. State is saved in localStorage, allowing persistent tracking. One of my earliest projects.
